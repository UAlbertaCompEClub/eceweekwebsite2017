What needs to be done for this repo

up next: 
* get it working on wordpress
* find/create a better background (Jess?)
* customize header and footer elements 
* get pictures from last year
* Another site for HackED

future (when we know more): 
* IEEE/SPIE? Workshops? combining TT and M? - relies on structural decisions
* fade effect on TT speaker pics with name,topic,time,place.

Potential ideas:
